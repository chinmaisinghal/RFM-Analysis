#  RFM Analysis with Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** on customer transaction data using Python. RFM analysis is a powerful marketing technique that helps businesses segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

---

## Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Calculation of **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** values per customer
* Customer segmentation based on RFM scores
* Insights for customer targeting and retention strategies
* Implemented in Python using **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib/seaborn** for visualization

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rfm-analysis-python.git
   cd rfm-analysis-python
  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "RFM Analysis with py.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run all cells to perform RFM analysis on the dataset.

## Example Output

* **Recency**: Days since last purchase
* **Frequency**: Number of purchases made
* **Monetary**: Total amount spent
* Segmented customers into groups such as *Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Hibernating*, etc.

---


* Add clustering methods (K-means, Hierarchical) for advanced segmentation
* Automate scoring with functions
* Dashboard visualization using Plotly/Streamlit
